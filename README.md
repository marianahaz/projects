Some of my smaller, mostly personal, projects

<b>Chinese zodiac calculator</b>

Chinese zodiac is composed of 12 different animals, which creates a cycle that restarts every 12 years. In 1995, for example, it was the year of the pig, so people born in that year are considered to have their chinese sign as pig.

This small projects takes the user year as input and returns their chinese zodiac sign.
